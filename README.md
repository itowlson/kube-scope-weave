# kube-scope-weave README

The `kube-scope-weave` extension add [Weave Scope](https://www.weave.works/oss/scope/) functionality to the core VS Code Kubernetes extension experience.

## Features

Scope is a tool for visualizing and interacting with your Kubernetes applications that works against any Kubernetes cluster. This extension, which depends upon the [VS Code Kubernetes extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools) for core Kubernetes support, enables:

- installing Weave Scope using the [Helm stable Weave Scope chart](https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/stable/weave-scope).
- opening Scope to the appropriate context at:
  - Cluster
  - Node
  - Namespace
  - Service
  - Pod

## How to run

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. First of all, get all the prerequisites:
    - [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#installing-the-helm-client) + [Tiller](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#installing-tiller)
    - [VS Code Kubernetes extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools) - its API is used to create new behavior inside the core Kubernetes experience without having to rewrite any Kubernetes client
2. Clone this repo and run `npm install` to have all the dependencies installed
3. Open the project in VS Code and hit F5 to run a new instance with Scope plugin support
4. Run `Scope: Install Weave Scope` command (bring the command panel up with `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
5. Now open the Kubernetes extension - the _Open Weave Scope_ action should appear in the dropdown when right-clicking on the cluster or some of the individual K8s resources

_See the [this doc](https://github.com/squillace/kube-scope-weave/blob/master/vsc-extension-quickstart.md) for more information on how to run and test VS Code extensions._
=======
## Requirements

This extension uses the [VS Code Kubernetes extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools)'s API to create new behavior inside the core Kubernetes experience without having to rewrite any Kubernetes client code. Therefore, you must install that extension in order to use this one.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
- `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

- Detection of existing Scope installations is done by looking for the `frontend` endpoint in the current namespace. If it cannot be found, a new installation is created.
- Currently, the default namespace is used in the Kubernetes extension. This will be a selection in the future.

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.
